            <h1 class="">Problem Space</h1>
            <p>Our parent company TOTVS has a large sales department in Brazil, including a few home offices and many more local partner branches, selling dozens of enterprise software solutions to companies in different sizes and industries. One of the biggest problems for our sales managers is the lack of transparency in team’s sale progress, which makes them be less confident about completing monthly sales goals and setting up an appropriate sales goal for upcoming months. As today, different sales branches and units are using different software / customized excel sheets to manage their sales data, which is less accessible and accurate. Therefore, we started the concept design of Fluig Data Mobile Sale, a mobile app powered by Fluig Data, to become a handy tool for sales persons and offer overall transparency for sales managers.</p>

            <h1 class="">Target Users</h1>
            <p>There are two types of target users. First, we have sales managers as our target users, who want to have the visibility of how sales are going and get more analysis to support their sales prediction decision making process. As today, they have to call each sales team lead to get an idea about the sales completion and are working on sales prediction on sales data in excel sheets that are updated not in time. The second type of target user is salesman on the road. They are hardworking and always under pressure of sales goals. They are using old school CRM or excel sheets to update their sales activities, which takes much time and makes them be less willing to add an update. Inconsistent data across different data source also becomes a challenge for the sales analysis.</p>

            <h1 class="">Concept Design</h1>
            <p>The business goal behind the concept design is to standardize sales process, improve visibility and analysis, and in the end increase the sales productivity. Based on the business goal and two types of target users stated above, we designed a top-down flow for sales manager and a bottom-up flow to salesman.</p>
            <h2>Sales Manager Flow</h2>

            <p>If user logs in as a sales manager, he / she will get a sales report dashboard segmented in Customers, Opportunity, Analytics, and Team Members. Charts are introduced to visualize how far we are going in a standard sales process with customers and opportunities(a customer may have multiple opportunities, usually about different software solutions). Analytics section aggregates all sales information to present how many days on average each step has taken, which can be used to compare with history performance and adjust future predictions. At last, completed parts and sales goals are highlighted for each team member to give managers a heads-up of individual performance. Managers can drill in to each customer, opportunity, team member to check detailed information, which are the same view for salesman to be presented below.</p>

            <h2>Salesman Flow</h2>
            <p>Unlike the overview dashboard for sales managers, salesman gets a to-do style home screen started with upcoming meetings, followed by appointed customers. This helps salesman contact customers easily, navigate to meeting location conveniently, and always have customer information handy. Zooming in each customer’s view, all related information are integrated and displayed in priority depends on the sales status, including customer research, customer profile, existing contracts, opportunities (contracts in negotiation), past and upcoming meetings. One layer down in the opportunity view, contract negotiation timeline is provided with the reference of history data to encourage salesman to get the deals done sooner.</p>
