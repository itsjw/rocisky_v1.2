            <h1 class="">Topic</h1>
            <p>We go shopping every week, online or offline. Coupon, discount, promotion are good friends for shopping. Mailboxes, both physical and digital ones, are always stuffed with coupons and newsletters. However, most of them are not that helpful or even relevant, waisting our time to read and discard them. But we do love price cut. When we want to shop some brands or look for a hotel in Las Vegas, we sign up an account and hope to get some promotions right in time. Unfortunately, expected discounts seldom come, but email campaigns and nice printings will keep coming on schedule in the future.
            </p>
            <p>Depends on personal habits and what we shop, sometimes we need to do a little bit research before making a purchase decision. What kinds of research we do today? Maybe google the product and check the Amazon reviews could help. But what we get from Google or Amazon review are more product specs and reviews made by people we don’t know. It is better than nothing, but does it answer our questions? We may still be not sure whether the product fit us or not.</p>
            <p>Apparently retailers are not as worried about the explosive amount of advertisement as potential customers. But there is always a cost to print them out, or to leave a good impression in user’s email account. Retailers are always welcome to new advertisement channel and more efficient targeting offering process.</p>

            <p>What are the factors that will affect someone’s purchase decision? In my opinions, price, quality, time (delivery or traffic for in-store shopping), and fitness are the top four in general, followed by factors that are more personal, like brand preference, apparel, etc. In this concept design, the target user is set as shoppers that care a lot in price, quality, and fitness. They have time to do some research for shopping, and want to find the right product instead of shopping something urgent, or just because it is very cheap.</p>

            <h2>Shopping List</h2>
            <p>The app is organized in a shopping list, where end user creates wished item. After a wished item is created, for example a SLR camera, popular options with lowest price and detailed descriptions will be provided and kept updated by the system after crawling major retailer websites. Meanwhile, partner retailers will have access to how many people is looking for certain items, so they can consider creating customized coupons for customers.</p>

            <h2>Social Recommendation</h2>
            <p>Besides price, quality and fitness also key factors for us to make a satisfied purchase. There are already lots of helpful review articles and social reviews. But they are not good enough, because they may know the product, they don’t know the customer. Our friends know us better. If they are also looking for or have already bought something similar, their comments and suggestions could be much more trustworthy and valuable. This is why social module is added, and the app will show you how many more friends are also looking for such options and provides a place for discussion per wished item.</p>
