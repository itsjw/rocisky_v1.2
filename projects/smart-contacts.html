            <h1 class="">Problem Space</h1>
            <p>We found the problem from a meeting with the Consulate of Brazil. There is one team there dedicating for helping build relationships among high-tech Brazilian companies in silicon valley. As today, they manage and store the contact information of such companies based on personal phone contacts, Microsoft Exchange email contacts, excel sheets, and piles of physical business cards. It is inefficient and difficult for them to consolidate these contact information and keep them updated. When there is a request for a list of companies from government, event organizers, or companies seeking for collaborations, they are always in short of time and lack of confidence, since some information may be outdated and including some companies but missing other similar ones could be unfair. They are very in need of a tool to better integrate business contacts from different sources.</p>
            <p>Later, after interviewing some high level business people from several companies, we were able to prove the existence of the challenges in managing business contact and further define the problems as lack of mobility, integration, de-duplication, and enrichment in managing business contact information.</p>

            <h1 class="">Target Users</h1>
            <p>Our target users are people who needs to manage lots of business contacts, including managers, salesman, assistants, etc. They meet people in different occasions and have their contact information stored in different places, such as phone contacts, email accounts, LinkedIn, physical business cards. They have a large amount of contacts, most of which may not be frequently contacted. When they need to find contact, they may not remember the name and only have some vague memories of which company he / she works for, when and where they met.</p>

        <div class="content is-medium column is-6">
            <h1 class="">Solution</h1>
            <p>We decided to design SmartContacts as a mobile app, so users will always have the contact information by hand. It is also easier to create new contacts in the context of informal meetings and events, with time and location meta information saved upon users’ permissions. Another benefit is to take advantage of phone camera to quickly scan a physical business card and convert it into a digital contact. In the future, scanning QR code, detecting, adding, and sharing contacts via bluetooth and NFC could be further added to empower the application.</p>

            <p>I designed the merge function. Merge is not something new or fancy in a mobile contact app, but most existing solutions only provide merge without previews. Taking advantage of the merge rule, survivorship rule settings of Fluig Data, we are able to provide more sophisticated merge criterial to tackle our use cases of merging from different sources. User can review each merge candidate, preview the final results, and select the right ones to merge when it reaches a complicated case.</p>
