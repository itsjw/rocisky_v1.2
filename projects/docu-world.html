However, documentary videos have been less covered in these new platforms. Compared with movies and TV programs, documentary videos has much less population. But there are always people interested in them and lots of great documentary videos are in lack of exposure. With the trending that people watch videos more often on smartphones during leisure time, documentary videos, usually shorter and less addictive, could be a good candidate for such mobile users to consume.</p>
