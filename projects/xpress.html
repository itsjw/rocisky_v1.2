                Many second language learners want to speak fluently to native speakers. However, formal language education and existing tools are insufficient for learning language for use in daily life. We propose Xpress, a mobile Q&A-based system that crowdsources native speakers to help second language learners acquire diverse colloquial expressions through composing “context-embedded” questions with the help of multimedia. We employed an iterative user-centered design process including contextual inquiry, affinity diagram, personas & scenarios, storyboards, sketches, wireframes, lo-fi prototype, heuristic evaluation, mid-fi prototype, and user testing. We are one of the eleven student teams invited for a poster presentation in the CHI 2013 conference.

            <p>
                Many people learn a second language for study, work or their own interests. Speaking, especially facilitating what they have learnt into daily use is one of the biggest challenges for second language learners. Taking international students as an example, though they do well in the academic study, some of them may have troubles in or want to improve their daily communications with natives, which makes them difficult to further get familiar with the local culture and get involved in the community life.

            <h1 class="">Contextual Inquiry</h1>
            <p>
                To better understand second language learning and identify the challenges, we interviewed 8 second language learners, 5 language instructors, and conducted 6 field observations of a Chinese learning Meetup group by attending their weekly meetings. After collecting notes, we created an affinity wall to observe a conspicuous gap between existing language learning tools and the pragmatic needs for learning native colloquial expressions. We found current leanring methods and tools do not well satisfy second language learners’ needs of learning diverse colloquial expressions. To learn colloquial expressions, feedback from native speakers is valuable, but it may not be always convenient to find a native speaker.

            <h1 class="">Ideation and Solution</h1>
            <p>
                Based on the findings from Contextual Inquiry, we continued brainstorming and did some research on the current language learning products. Since every second language learner is the expert of his or her first language and it takes little effort to provide one’s native expressions, we believe it is possible and beneficial to build a platform, where second language learners learning different languages can help each other. We decided to crowdsource native speakers and take advantage of mobile computing devices to help users better capture and describe contexts with the help of multimedia. With the initial solution in minds, we created storyboards to illustrate scenarios and discussed lots of sketches to explore possible features.

            <h1 class="">Prototyping and Evaluation</h1>
            <p>
                Based on the sketch, we first created paper prototyping, which focuses more on layout and basic features. We showed the paper prototype to several second language learners for informal evaluation. Later, we started to standardize user interface and work on the interaction flow in our Lo-Fi prototype using Balsamiq. We designed a few simple tasks and tested the Lo-Fi with 6 second language learners, which verified our design concept but revealed major concern of intuitiveness. Then we had several whiteboard discussions and redesigned the prototype by prioritizing and simplifying features. We built our Mid-Fi prototype in Android phone using Adobe Flex. In the user testing, we observed 5 Chinese learners and 5 English learners interacting with the prototype and using it in the field.

            <p>
                Users’ participation plays an important role in such a crowdsourcing system. To encourage users’ participation, we have the following incentive designs. We designed Coins to prevent the free-rider issue and reinforce a user’s motivation to answer questions. Coins are required for users to ask an expression question and they can be earned through answering questions. We also designed Karma, which represents the reputation score for encouraging users to provide high-quality expressions. At last, we encourage users to provide their own expressions attached to a question they ask. This allows users learning the questioner’s native language to hear what the questioner would have said in the same situation.
