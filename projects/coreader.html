            <h1 class="">Problem</h1>
            <p>
                We read everyday, but we don’t have much time to consume the huge amount of information being created. In the age of information overload, how to get valuable information during limited time to enrich ourselves becomes a problem for almost everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the past, people got information from books, newspapers, and word of mouth. These have been changed taking advantages of internet, digital media, mobile, etc. However, the changes are made majorly on where to read and how much to read. The real challenge is how to efficiently figure out which to read on the perspectives of potential values to each individual person.

            <h1 class="">Existing Solutions</h1>
            <p>
                There are thousands of exiting places for people’s daily reading. I would like to classify them into following categories.
            </p>
            <figure class="image">
                <img src="../images/projects/coreader/bloomberg.png" alt="Bloomberg">
            </figure>
            <h2>News Website</h2>
            <p>
                News websites cover information that is time sensitive, popular, with social impact. Most of these are news reports and reports of same topic are very similar from different news services. Going through news websites / applications is not very efficient. Users end up in finding only a few articles to read spending much time navigating news lists from different news providers. Information coming from this type of sources is non or less filtered.
            </p>
            <figure class="image">
                <img src="../images/projects/coreader/medium.png" alt="Medium">
            </figure>
            <h2>Social Media</h2>
            <p>
                Information from social media is more fragmental and with personal opinions. Users consume such information from the others users they follow. They are reading things filtered by their preferences, but the problem is there are too many places to read, different social network platforms, personal blogs.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <h2>Aggregation Service</h2>
            <p>
                While aggregation tools are doing well on providing a single place to read everything subscribed, comment module is usually left out. In my opinion, following discussions could play a important role in this type of information sources.
            </p>

        <div class="content is-medium column is-8">
            <h1 class="">Target Users</h1>
            <p>
                The concept design is targeting at users who read news, social medias to keep themselves updated with what happened in the world and also have some specific preferences in topics and depth of reading materials.

        <div class="column is-2"></div>
        <div class="content is-medium column is-8">
            <h1 class="">Concept Design</h1>

            <p>
                The goal of this concept design is to provide a better reading service for such users to quickly get a glance of news, identify things to read, and support following discussions or personal notes to better consume information.
            </p>

                The solution can be divided into two modules, news and opinions by types of information. In news module, it aggregates reports from major news websites. The dashboard provides a quick view of what is happening around the world based on trending, including events, organizations, people, and geo information. After zooming in a certain topic, it provides a list of news from different news providers in the order of popularity and personal preferred sources. The reading part focuses on the news content itself, excluding distracts such as advertisement. During or after reading the main content, users can also find some related information on the right panel, for example, short bio and related news.
            </p>

            <figure class="image">

            </figure>
            <p>
                The opinions module is more based on manual subscriptions and friends’ recommendations. The assumption here is that users have certain topics they are very interested in, want to pay continuous attention and have followed a group of sources that could be bloggers, friends, field specialists. Therefore, the opinion dashboard is designed for grouping information by topics, highlighting both new coming items and items recommended by friends. In the reading view, personal notes and filtered friends’ comments, popular comments are provided to enhance and encourage engagement and reflection to better consume information.
