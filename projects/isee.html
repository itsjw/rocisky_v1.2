            <p>This is a course project that aims at exploring design for panorama, 360 photo, and other immersive technologies. Due to the limitation of time, the scope is set as small as shooting panorama / 360 photo while traveling. Target users are people who would like to share their experience with family members and close friends.</p>
            <p>In the past, people wrote journals and told stories when traveling. Today, we took photos and post them on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. The spirit of sharing have never been changed. When we are visiting some most spectacular spots, we really want to share the amazing scene in front of us with our family and friends. So we take a photo, or even better, a panorama. And what is next? Posting it on social channels sounds like a good choice, from which we get lots of likes. However, sometimes we need a little bit more than that. We really want to talk more about the scene, and start a conversation from there.</p>

            <p>Panorama and 360 photo can present a bigger scene to audience, but it also brings the potential lost of focus. Therefore, Tags feature is designed for resolve this issue and help users add more personal comments in context.
            </p>
            <p>Sharing the amazing scene with others is good, but there might be more we could do here. If user chooses to share it privately to another use or a group of users, a conversation UI will be integrated into the post so everybody involved can start a conversation using text or voice.</p>
