            <h1 class="">Summary of Work</h1>
            <p>Fluig Identity is a cloud based identity and access management system for enterprise to manage access, provision accounts, and provide single sign on for their employees. As the solo designer at that time, I worked on UI design, flow design, feature improvement, and design of the new and most complex module, resource access control. In addition, I also worked on the improvement of fluig identity one time password mobile app, a prototype with Google Glass, and a concept design on mobile shopping app with beacon technology on iOS and later apple watch during the work of fluid identity.</p>

            <h1 class="">Toggle Button</h1>
            <p>I joined TOTVS Labs in late Sep, 2013 after graduating from University of Michigan. It was my first full time non-internship job and Fluig Identity just had its 1.0 release at that time. First day of work was great, meeting the team, learning Fluig Identity, and setting up accounts. I remember my first week of work was conducting heuristic evaluation and designing a Yes / No toggle button. I created a long list of existing issues and potential improvements, discussed various versions of toggle button with my mentor and everything looked promising.</p>
            <p>Then the challenge began in the second week, my mentor, the senior designer who designed Fluig Identity, left in a sudden. I became the only designer, who knows nothing about why things were designed in this way and what to do next. To be honest, I was a little panic at that time. There were only a few outdated documents for reference. I was not very confident about my design because I wasn’t sure whether I understood the problem right, followed the consistency, or was fully aware how a design change might affect the system. I was lucky to get lots of belief, support, and help from the team. Soon, I realized even if it was not the situation I preferred, as designers, we face the problems and look for solutions. Bigger challenge also means bigger opportunity.</p>

            <h1 class="">From UI to Features</h1>
            <p>While time was flying, my work changed from designing UI elements, redesigning page view, to designing new flow and features, gradually. When I first joined the team, we were in lack of consistency in UI, so I worked with front end team to put up a simple style guide. With the new style guide, I started polish and redesign all views. Soon, I got familiar with the system logic and was able to point out some flaws in flows and start proposing for improvement in features. During daily work, I discussed features with product owner, learned possibilities and limits with development team, crafted designs, and looked for bugs and things to improve within the system.</p>

            <p>In early 2014, we accepted a new challenge from our headquarter, integrating Fluig Identity with more than ten major TOTVS enterprise software to support resource and access control in detail to menu items. The ultimate vision is to present customized widgets from different software to users with different authorizations on Fluig platform. It was certainly a big challenge and huge work to do.</p>

            <h1 class="">Design for Complexity</h1>
            <p>
                When we got the task from headquarter, we knew the complexity because most of our enterprise software were developers more than ten years ago, let alone the inconsistency caused by acquisitions from recent years. But we still underestimated the challenge until we started talking to first four product teams. They all have different flows and structures in the perspective of user authorizations. In addition, as the problems all on premises software have, they have a considerable number of patches related to user access control to satisfy needs from different clients. It took us some time to fully understand how user access control are established in these software. Soon we realized that the original goal of having only one flow to handle every case became less realistic. We also learnt that the scope had to be limited at sometime and a line needed to be drawn to make sure we could still accomplish the project in time.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the initial talk with twelve product teams, we handpicked five of them as the typical and primary use cases. Based on the meetings with these five product teams, I started to draft models and flows that work well on Fluig Identity existing structure and also keep as many pathways as possible from original software. After a few iterations, I was able to convinced the team that all cases can be categorized into four models on Fluig Identity. With the models in hand, we successfully negotiated with those five product teams on how their features can be built on our side and which minor patches wouldn’t be supported or needed to be altered. Later, we explained the models to the rest teams and asked them to work with us closely to pickup one of the existing models or propose a new one if needed. Luckily, four models work for all teams in the end, with some expansions to be added.

            <p>
                With all the models and flows finalized, the challenges remained at how to integrate all these into existing Fluig Identity design. Before this, Fluig Identity was built on top of a user, group, application triangular relationship that each one cloud be assigned to others in both ways. Now we needed to add another layer to application, resource including company, role, and menu items. To put it into a simply way, it is like adding another triangular group under application, but supporting company, role, or menu items(depends on which model it is) to be directly associated with user or group. I was glad at that time I had already transformed our design suite to Sketch plus InVision instead of Photoshop and Omnigraffle when I first joined the company. At last, I created more than twelve InVision prototypes to communicate with front end team and present to all product teams.

            <h1 class="">If I could start from the beginning</h1>
            <p>
                The resource access control project took us around 8 months. With some other small features added and partial UI redesign, we handed over Fluig Identity to headquarter for further development and operation and moved on a new project, Fluig Data.             </p>
            <p>
                Fluig Identity had been improved a lot since I first joined TOTVS Labs, with more powerful features, flexible flows, and clean user interface. I was satisfied with the enhancement and my growth along the way. However, I couldn’t stop thinking what if I could design Fluig Identity from the very beginning, taking a user centered design approach, spending more efforts in user research, and validating features before actual development.             </p>
            <p>
                There are two major drawbacks that I might be able to avoid. First is the unnecessary complications in account settings and potential active directive multi accounts flaw caused by multi-context structure. Fluig Identity was designed as pure enterprise software initially. But at some point, we added a personal launchpad, hoping it would also hit the single user market. It was not too much effort to add this feature at the beginning, but the change of scope resulted in much more time in later development with personal context protection in the multi-context concepts and Microsoft Active Directory integrations. Secondly, if we knew we were going to have resource access control supported earlier, there were chances to design the whole user, group, application, resource relationships in a simpler way. From my perspective, Fluig Identity was first designed to support full flexibilities and customizations which worked well at the initial scope. However with the expansion of scope and added complexities, such flexibilities and customizations had become huge burdens for design and development because there were way too many use cases to be supported, most of which rarely used. In the end, such flexibilities and customizations caused the lack of focus on primary flows and challenges for admin users to onboard.             </p>
