            <p>
                In early 2015, we got a new mission from headquarter to work on a master data management project. The initial goal of the project was to build a data hub for all TOTVS enterprise software, serve as a single version of truth, and provide analytics. Later, the project was extended to a more powerful data platform, Fluig Data, which connects to software to collect, normalize, redistribute data and provide smart recommendations based on graph technology and artificial intelligence. Chin-Wei Wong and I collaborated on this product design together. We were successful to introduce more user research into the project development comparing with the previous project Fluig Identity. Within the collaborations, I was mainly responsible for the early design of information architecture, features, and flows while Chin-wei focused more on interaction design, user interface, and project management.             </p>

            <p>
                To be honest, that was my first reaction after hearing the next project we were going to work on was Fluig Data. Almost nobody in the team had much knowledge of master data management. It was a great time for team to work together on finding the answer. After a few weeks of industry research, competitors analysis, and a three day bootcamp hold by an industry expert, we finally had learned the concept, scope, existing solutions, future opportunities of master data management. In short, unlike transactional data which documents an event (i.e. somebody bought something), master data describes the profile of a pre-defined data model, such as customer (name, birthday, gender, account number, contact information, etc.). I was again convinced how domain knowledge plays an significant role in product design from the initial research.

            <p>
                The most thing I love about this project is that I finally have got a chance to design a product from zero, just like those academic projects in my master study but of course in a much larger scale. One thing I believe we did well at the beginning this time is that we were fairly prepared before the initial product development, being familiar with the current markets. We were clear and confident about on which we should follow the conventions and on which we could break the rule to introduce innovation to be more competitive in future markets. Working with management team, we design team decided the initial information architecture and general roadmap of features in phase one. The definition of information architecture created an important common ground for everyone in the team to discuss feature development. For the first version, we designed the product into four basic modules, which were data models, applications, govern, and Fluig Data admin app.

            <p>
                One thing I learned this time from designing a data centric product is that it is absolutely important to design with real data and customers. Thanks to the customer development plan from management team, we were able to collaborate with potential customers at the very beginning of product development, which means we have real data for testing. Closely working with potential customers also gave us the benefits to focus on existing customer problems and validate our design constantly.
